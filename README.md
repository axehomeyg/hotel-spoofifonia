# hotel-spoofifonia
A script that lets you temporarily spoof your browserless AppleTV (or other device) MAC address on your computer so that you can accept Hotel Wi-Fi terms of service.

# disclaimer
This isn't usually illegal, and most hotel IT staff already expect you to call with MAC address in hand, so that they can add you to the whitelist.

## usage
1) ./run.sh on a computer

2) Provide AppleTV mac address at the prompt

3) Connect to your hotel's wifi with your computer

4) Upon exit, connect Apple TV to hotel wifi

5) Profit!
